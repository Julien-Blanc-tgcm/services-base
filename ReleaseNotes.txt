Focus of Version 16.10
-------------------------------
Continued Platform Support
Base Services has been tested on every supported platform to ensure that it builds and functions correctly. The samples and documentation have also both been updated in order to improve the developer experience. Remaining prominent issues are listed in the Known Issues section below.

Updating to Core 16.10
Base Services has been updated to use the most recent 16.10 version of AllJoyn Core.

Improving Robustness of Onboarding
Substantial effort has been made to address the stability of Onboarding across devices. Of 21 total onboarding tasks completed, 13 were bug fixes.

Security 2.0
Security 2.0 is now supported by the sample Onboarding Client and Daemon. Support for multiple ECDHE-based authentication mechanisms was added: NULL, PSK, SPEKE, and ECDSA.

Substantial Code and Documentation Maintenance
Deficiencies in the code and documentation were identified during the development of Base Services 16.04 release. Many of these were addressed early in the 16.10 development cycle, to simplify the implementation of new features and bug fixes.

IRB Interface Definitions
Though unscheduled, the IRB requested assistance in finalizing Base Servicesâ€™ interface definitions. This work was completed and is awaiting final approval. See the gerrit change (https://git.allseenalliance.org/gerrit/6353) for details.
