Onboarding a LIFX White 800
===========================

run
    OnboardingClient -wifi "TwoBulls 2.4" -psk 000000

The -wifi option provides the wifi network that the lamp is to be
onboarded to.  There will be a password prompt.

At the prompt switch to the LFX _AJ wireless network.  The lamp
will be configured and then there will be a prompt to switch to the
above wifi network.  There should be another announcement in the
new network.

In the log there will be a GetState call which would return 0 for
not configured and then later 3 for CONFIGURED_VALIDATED.
